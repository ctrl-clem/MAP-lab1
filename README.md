# 📘 Complex Numbers Calculator

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a Complex Numbers Calculator built using multiple design principles such as:

## 🏗 Factory Pattern for creating different types of operations

🔄 Template Method for structured execution of expressions

🔁 Singleton Pattern for managing a single instance of the expression factory

The calculator can verify, parse, evaluate, and compute complex number expressions dynamically! 🎯

## 🛠️ Features

✅ Parse mathematical expressions with complex numbers (e.g., 3+2i + 4-5i / 5+7i)
✅ Perform operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
✅ Implemented using clean OOP principles with extensibility in mind
✅ Supports step-by-step evaluation for complex expressions

## 🏗️ Design Patterns Used

### 🎭 Factory Pattern

The ExpressionFactory dynamically creates the appropriate expression object based on the operator.

### 🔄 Template Pattern

The ComplexExpression class ensures that the same execution structure is followed for every operation.

### 🔁 Singleton Pattern

The ExpressionFactory follows a singleton pattern to ensure a single instance is used throughout the program.
